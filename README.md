# n Gram Implement
In the study, n-gram analysis was performed on the corpus containing Turkish characters. These n-gram analyzes are 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram. Java and Pyhon programming languages were used while analyzing. The frequencies for each n-gram were listed from highest to lowest and one hundred items with the highest frequency were found. After performing these operations in both languages, runtime was tested.
